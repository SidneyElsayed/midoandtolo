AlUla is a magical place. It’s one of those places where the photos don’t do it justice, which is crazy because I’ve seen some pretty incredible pictures from here. But nothing beats the feeling of seeing and experiencing this ancient crossroads of civilization for yourself.

That being said, I’ve come up with a few tips for visiting. Some might seem obvious, but you’d be surprised how many people I’ve encountered who wish they would’ve known these helpful pointers before coming.

## Your shoes will get dusty

The desert is dusty. Obvious? This one gets first priority because it’s funny, but oh so very true. My shiny black boots are now permanently dust colored; same for others who unwittingly brought their nice, new shoes along for the adventure. People laugh when I tell them your things will all be AlUla-colored by the time you leave, but it’s true. Visiting any of the landmarks around AlUla, there will be sand around. Want to get close to the tombs at Hegra? Sand. Frame the perfect picture at Elephant Rock? Sand. Walk through Told Town? Sand. Even to take the iconic photo at the mirrored building, Maraya means walking through sand.

***What to do about it:*** Know your shoes will get dusty and adjust. Bring a favorite worn-in pair for walking around. Plenty of ladies here still wear high heels, but I personally have no idea how. Comfortable trainers are also seen frequently, or a good dust colored something. Toms are our current go-to, because they’re also easy to wash.

## Getting around AlUla

Best advice: rent a car. AlUla is a long, skinny valley and things can be pretty spread out. To get around easily and on your own time, rent a car. Driving is Saudi gets a bad rep (not without reason), but AlUla is still a small town and driving isn’t all that bad. There are taxis and Careem, but that also adds up quickly (and takes time for them to get to you).

Just remember the rule is there are no rules – at least that’s what it can feel like when it comes to driving. Lanes are just suggestions, as are turn signals. Don’t be surprised if someone cuts across your lane (or two) to catch that turn they were about to miss. The frontage/service road in the main town is actually the fast lane; people use it to skip traffic lights and radars, so beware. Cars sometimes seem to pop out of nowhere! Note that cars are allowed to right-turn on red and there are traffic cops positioned around the city (though I’ve never seen anyone pulled over).

***What to do about it:*** Take care of your surroundings. Driving is not *actually* that bad here, but first-time visitors should focus while on the road.

## Pharmacies

Dotted in every neighborhood, AlUla has a lot of well-stocked pharmacies. All of the pharmacists I have talked to also speak English, so they’re very helpful. In case the dust here has your allergies flare up, a cold or stomach bug gets ya or anything in between, there’s modern medicine to help – it’s not that rural.

***Pro tip: Ladies, bring your toiletries.*** Pads galore, highly lacking on tampons. Not to say that you can’t find them, but just plan ahead, rather than run around town with no guarantee. You’re welcome.

## The sun shines brighter here

The sun just hits differently here. The reflection of the sun on the sand seems to amplify the sun’s rays, and there’s not big-city smog to block the UV rays. Especially in the winter months when it feels cooler, the sun is still very strong. No one wants to be sunburned five minutes in to an epic trip like this.

***What to do about it:***  Bring your favorite sunscreen from home. In case you need more, the pharmacies carry plenty of sunscreen. Wear a hat or bring a scarf to cover up. A light windbreaker in the summer is also a good idea.
