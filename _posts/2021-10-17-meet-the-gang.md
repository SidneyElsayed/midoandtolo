##### Everyone in the family has a name. Well that might sound obvious, but not when you realize who and what is considered part of the family.&nbsp;

## **Mido**

Don’t let the big hair fool you, there are plenty of secrets hidden in that head of his. Ahmed is a mastermind of social media, paid campaign wiz and all-around marketing genius – but the real fun is in the journey. From his start as real-life ‘Scuba Steve’ to helping put Saudi on the map as an international travel destination, I’m convinced there’s nothing this man can’t do.

## **Tolo**


An adventurous spirit with a will to wander, I’m Sidney, the writer/developer half of Mido and Tolo. It’s a lot harder to write about myself, but I’m pretty great too. From studying humanitarian aid to teaching to copywriting and now web development, I’ve learned that no one person is just one thing. Having coined the phrase ‘No Plan Plan’ early on in my life, when in doubt – just wing it.

## **ZouZou**


Saudi-born rescue pup, ZouZou is just ZouZou – we don’t know the breed, nor do we really want to – though it’s always fun to speculate. Her name comes from the Egyptian classic “Khalli Balak min ZouZou” (Watch out for ZouZou) because when she was a tiny puff, she had very dramatic eyeliner reminiscent of the 70s Arab movie stars. Stubborn and sweet, she’s changing the way people in the region view dogs one pat at a time.

## **Raptor**


Big boy Raptor is a silver 2014 Ford Raptor. He joined the fam just before we took off on the first epic road trip from Dubai to AlUla, when we were in need of a true adventure car. (The little Kia rental just couldn’t cut it.) Two years in, he’s racked up over 40,000km (almost 25,000 miles).

## **Charlie**


A South African thrifted single-speed, Charlie kept me sane during covid. From photo tours of Cape Town’s street art, navigating the cafes of Muizenberg and playing with the penguins of Simon’s Town, Charlie had to continue on the adventure – Mido even somewhat held him for ransom in Dubai (but that’s another story).

## **Mr. Giant**

When I got to Dubai, Charlie felt lonely, so Mido got Mr. Giant second-hand. A trusty steed, Mr. Giant has traversed the Dubai Marina as well as AlUla’s Oasis. Definitely more hearty than Charlie, the pair have had their share of adventures together.
