## Top 5 Favorite Dives Sites in Dahab 

While Dahab is famous (if not infamous) for the Blue Hole, there is so much more to see than that one site.

## 1\. Islands

An absolutely stunning dive site, this site is a natural buoyancy park. While there aren’t islands per se, the site gets its name from the underwater islands of corals. You’ll need a bit of control, so it won’t be your first dive in Dahab, but it’s fairly shallow. I also know tec divers who have taken doubles and stayed for hours.

**Entry:** Shore

**Max depth:** 12m

**Notes:** Entry is a bit dependent on tides

## 2\. Canyon

Have you ever wanted to be in the cavern from ‘The Little Mermaid’? This is it, I swear. Once you find the crack in the sea floor, divers go one by one down into the canyon, where it opens up to a more sandy bottom. Many Advanced Course students do their deep dive here, as it’s safe and easy to kneel and check colors and do finger math.

**Entry:** Shore

**Max depth:** 30m

**Notes:** If you’re a nervous diver, be clear with your guide the order going into the canyon. Also don’t forget to check out the fish bowl (but don’t go in it)!

## 3\. Caves

So these are not really caves, more like an overhang of underwater rock – so no cave diving experience or licenses necessary. You get to see your bubbles trapped on the ceiling of the ’cave,’ like nowhere else I’ve been before.

**Entry:** Shore jump to deep water

**Max depth:** 40m

**Notes:** The entry and exit of this one can be a challenge, depending on tides and weather. Think of it like jumping into a pool and having to climb out without a ladder.

## 4\. 3 Pools

I’ve got a soft spot for this place, since I did my first night dive here (which unfortunately is no longer permitted). The south has a few spots all with similar entries, so makes for a great easy dive day for beginners.

**Entry:** Shore

**Max depth:** 25m

**Notes:** Take a close look at the sand underwater – this is where I learned Dahab, meaning ‘gold’ in Arabic got its name from the shimmering gold sand.

## 5\. Lighthouse

Might be controversial, since it feels like the most boring and basic of dive sites in Dahab, but it actually has a ton of fish and is a great intro to the Red Sea. I also am a huge fan of the buoyancy park they’ve created and the different underwater sculptures.

**Entry:** Shore

**Max depth:** 60m+

**Notes:** It also gets really deep pretty quickly, which is why it’s also great for freedive and tec training.

### Honorable mention of the Blue Hole

I’ve written a whole post for a more in depth write-up on Egypt’s Blue Hole, but if you dive the Canyon, you’re most likely headed to the Blue Hole next. It’s a cool dive, especially entering through Bell’s and to say you’ve did the dive in the place – but my honest opinion is that it’s a better snorkeling spot anyway. Still take the entrance with the divers at Bell’s and drift along; the colorful fish are near the surface anyway.
