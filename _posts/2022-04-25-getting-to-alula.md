One of the last untapped places in the world, AlUla should most definitely be on your bucket list. Off the beaten path in the most literal sense, it does take a little planning to get here – but believe me when I say it’s so worth it. And you’ve got two of the town's best tour guides to help lead the way.

## AlUla International Airport

First things first, hardly anyone outside of AlUla spells AlUla correctly. This is especially difficult when trying to search for flights. The airport code is **ULH**, and it’s best to use for searching flight routes into this magical city.

## International or Domestic Flights

There are a few ways to get here, both domestic and international. Ever-expanding the roster of cities AlUla flies in and out of, the major players are Riyadh and Jeddah for domestic flights and Amman, Cairo, Bahrain, Dubai, and Qatar internationally. During peak season there is also a mystical direct flight from Paris, but only incoming, not outbound.

## Saudi Visas and Immigration

A modern-day bus station, AlUla’s airport is small. Perks of this mean you never really have to be at the airport more than an hour in advance when leaving, but the downside is the low immigration capacity when entering. This means domestic flights, where there is no immigration, enter much more quickly. If AlUla is on your Saudi itinerary, don’t make it your first stop so you can go through the bigger immigration hubs of Riyadh, Jeddah and Dammam. If you're coming to just AlUla, or it is your first stop, no worries! Get an [eVisa](https://visa.visitsaudi.com/) from the official Visit Saudi site. Didn’t do that on time? There are visas on arrival, but only one dude can issue it, so expect to wait.

## Nearby Cities

Really not finding what you need? Look at flying into the nearby cities of Medina or Tabuk, which have much bigger airports. Each about a 3-4 hour drive from AlUla, from there you can rent a car or hire a driver. A car is recommended in AlUla, but there are plenty of rental car options here if you’d rather have someone else do the long-haul.
